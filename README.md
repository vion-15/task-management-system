- **Day 3:** Comprehensive testing with Jest
- **Day 4:** Git workflow and collaboration features
- **Day 5:** Production deployment and best practices

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the development server
- `npm test` - Run tests (Day 3+)
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality (Day 3+)
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier (Day 3+)

## Getting Help

- Check the course materials for each day
- Ask your instructor if you get stuck
- Review the troubleshooting guides in the course documentation

## Next Steps

1. Make sure `npm start` works and you can see the welcome page
2. Familiarize yourself with the project structure
3. Wait for Day 1 materials to begin implementation

Happy coding! 🚀
